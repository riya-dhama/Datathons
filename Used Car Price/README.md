# Car Price
To determine the price of used cars.
## Task:
You have been hired by a new car trader company to help sell its used cars. You will be analyzing used cars from multiple manufacturers and of different models.

## Objective:
Your job is to help the car trader company determine the price of its used cars.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Submissions are evaluated using Mean Squared Error

## Structure:
### Task1: Load the Data and Import Essential Libraries
- Load the dataset using pandas.
- Import essential modules and helper functions from NumPy, Matplotlib, sklearn.
- Explore the dataframe using the head().

### Task 2: Inspect the Data
- Explore the dataframe using the shape, info() functions.
- Check the null values
- Get Statistical Overview using describe()

### Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
- For this dataset, I used a histogram, scatterplot() , correlation matrix, countplot(), piechart, using Seaborn & Matplotlib.
- Seaborn's Barplot(), lineplot() has been used to visualize year-wise increase/decrease of car price
- Seaborn boxplot to visualize outliers

### Task 4: Data-preprocessing:
- Handle missing values
- Handling muli-categorical features
- Drop irrelevent columns
- Convert Textual Data and Analyse the categorical variable.

### Task 5: Spliting Data into X(independent variables) and y (dependent variable)
- Spliting data to training and test set.

### Task 6: Train the model using Diffrent Alogorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### Task 7: Check accuracy score , MSE ,RMSE value on Test and Train set
### Task 8: Visualise the error graphically
### Task 9: preprocessing of Test Data and Prediction on TEST DATA
